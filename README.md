# Metamatrix Styleguide Starter Templates

## Getting started

Dependencies are:
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/)

Other stuff used are:
* [SASS (SCSS)](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Nunjucks (for HTML template rendering)](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

## Working with this project

* (Install node js if you haven't done that)
* (Install Grunt command line interface globally if you haven't done that: `npm install -g grunt-cli`)
* Clone the repository to your computer
* Run command `nmp install` to install all modules
* Run command `grunt serve` to start a server on localhost:9001

## Use this as a template for a new project

In order to copy files to a new repository you will need to use the terminal. To do this you need to create ssh-keys bo be able to connect to github. https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/

1. Create a new repository on Github with a name, for example "my-styleguide"
2. Open a terminal and cd to your local version of the styleguide repository, for example: C:\Repositories\mmx-styleguide
3. Run command to copy all files from the master branch to the master branch of your new repository: `git push git@github.com:Metamatrix/my-styleguide.git +master:master`
4. Clone the newly created repository to your computer
5. Edit packages.json file and update project name, git repository etc. You can also run the command `npm init` to do this.
6. Edit settings.json for your project
7. Run command `nmp install` to install all modules
8. Run command `grunt serve` to start a server on localhost:9001

## Use grunt task runner for this project

This project uses Grunt as task runner. How to use in the terminal:

* Run command `grunt serve` to start server and run all specified 'dev' tasks.
* Run command `grunt serve:dist` to start server and run all specified 'dist' tasks.
* If you add :validate to your command, grunt will also run validation tests (e.g. `grunt serve:dev:validate`).

## Visual regression test

In this project you can run BackstopJS to output a visual regression test report. All css selectors and other properties are specified in the config file named backstop.json.

* Run command `grunt backstop` to run test and see the test report in the browser
* Run command `grunt backstop:reference` to create a set of reference screenshots based on the selectors specified in the config file. Every time you make changes (intentionally) to a page element you should run this command to update the screenshot references.

Screenshot references, tests and the html report can be found in reports/backstop_data.

## Generating Components and Compositions

Use the commands `grunt component:my-component` or `grunt composition:my-composition` to quickly generate files for a new component or compositions and aslo include these in the styleguide:

`grunt component:my-component` would generate:

* src/nunjucks/components/my-component.njk
* src/scss/application/_my-component.scss

You can also create a JavaScript enhancer file with the command `grunt component:my-component:enhancer`

## Defenition of Done

Use these checklists to make sure you have completed a component or a template fully.

* [Definition of Done Component](https://github.com/Metamatrix/mmx-styleguide/blob/master/dod-component.md)
* [Definition of Done Template](https://github.com/Metamatrix/mmx-styleguide/blob/master/dod-page-template.md)

## Exporting files to .Net-project

You can use the command `grunt export` to export files for a .Net-project. The command will generate a directory named export where all assets like css, js, images and fonts are placed. You can then copy these files to your pr√≥ject. The default setting is that the command assumes that your assets in the project will be located in a directory called static. If this isn't the case you can change this in settings.json with the parameter projectAssetPath.
